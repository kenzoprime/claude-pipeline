## 📖 What is claude-pipeline?

claude-pipeline is a portable application designed to help you run multiple automated tasks using agents. It combines skills, hooks, scripts, and quality checks into one easy-to-use tool. Think of it as a system that manages many small helpers (agents) that work together to get things done in the right order.

The program does not need complicated setup steps or deep technical knowledge. You download the ready-to-use files, open them, and the tool starts working on its tasks. This makes it suitable for users who want reliable task automation without diving into programming.

## ⚙️ How claude-pipeline Works

claude-pipeline combines several parts to automate tasks efficiently:

- **Skills**: These are pre-built sets of actions the program’s agents can perform. For example, data processing, file management, or sending alerts.

- **Agents**: Think of agents as helpers that carry out specific tasks. Each agent runs independently but communicates with others when needed.

- **Hooks**: Hooks trigger actions at the right moment in the workflow, like when a file is updated or a task completes.

- **Orchestration scripts**: These scripts control the order in which tasks happen, making sure everything runs smoothly.

- **Quality gates**: They check results and stop the process if something goes wrong, so you only get reliable outcomes.

All these parts work together inside claude-pipeline to make complex workflows simple. Once set up, you just start the program and let it handle the work.

## 🛠️ Setting Up Your First Pipeline

Here is a step-by-step example to get your first pipeline running:

1. **Open claude-pipeline**

2. **Create a new agent**

   Click the “New Agent” button and choose a task from the skills list, such as “File Organizer”.

3. **Add hooks**

   Set up triggers like “On new file” so that your agent knows when to start working.

4. **Link agents with orchestration**

   Use the orchestration section to arrange multiple agents. For example: 

   Agent 1: Download data → Agent 2: Process data → Agent 3: Save results

5. **Enable quality gates**

   Turn on checks that verify each agent’s output. If there is a problem, the pipeline stops and notifies you.

6. **Save your pipeline**

   Give it a name and save your settings.

7. **Run your pipeline**

   Click the “Start” button. You will see the status and logs as the agents complete their tasks.
